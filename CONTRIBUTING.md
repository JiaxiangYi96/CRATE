    - Pull the most recent version of CRATE's 'master' branch into your local repository;
    - Create and new development branch and commit your contribution;
    - Push your contribution to the 'origin' remote;
    - Create a Pull Request from your forked repository ('head repository') to [CRATE's GitHub repository](https://github.com/bessagroup/CRATE) ('base repository');
    - The Pull Request is reviewed by the project's owners and your contribution is merged depending on the outcome of the review process.
