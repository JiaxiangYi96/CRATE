# This program initial version was coded by Bernardo P. Ferreira (bpferreira@fe.up.pt,
# CM2S research group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering,
# University of Porto) and developed in colaboration with Dr. Miguel A. Bessa
# (m.a.bessa@tudelft.nl, Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering,
# Delft University of Technology) and Dr. Francisco M. Andrade Pires (fpires@fe.up.pt,
# CM2S research group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering,
# University of Porto).

# Credits:
# This program structure was inspired on the original Self-Consistent Clustering Analysis
# Matlab code implemented and developed by Dr. Zeliang Liu and Dr. Miguel A. Bessa in the
# course of the research published in "Self-consistent clustering analysis: an efficient
# multi-scale scheme for inelastic heterogeneous materials. Comp Methods Appl M 305 (2016):
# 319-341 (Liu, Z., Bessa, M.A. and Liu, W.K.)".
